SUBJECT: AI automation for logistics - reducing quote time by 95%

Hi Ahmed,

I saw that Global Freight Forwarders Ltd is handling freight forwarding operations. Many companies like yours are losing 60%+ of quotes to competitors due to manual quoting processes.

We help logistics companies automate quote generation using AI multi-agent systems. Our customers reduce quote time from 2-3 hours → 10-30 seconds, while maintaining 95% accuracy.

Are you open to a 15-minute call to see how AI can transform your quoting process?

Best,
Molty
AI Automation Specialist

```bash
cd structure-logistics/scripts
node email-outreach-generator.js
